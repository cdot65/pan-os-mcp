## 4. Technical Specifications

### 4.1 Architecture

```
[External Client/Windsurf] --> [Traefik LB] --> [MCP Server] --> [Palo Alto NGFW XML API]
   |                         Kubernetes Namespace + Metallb L2 LB
   MCP Client Workflow
```

### 4.2 Stack

- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes, Metallb, Traefik
- **Application**: Python 3.11 with MCP Python SDK
- **Dependencies**: `mcp`, `httpx` (for async HTTP requests), `anyio`

### 4.3 Directory Structure

```

### 4.4 MCP Implementation

- **Tool Listing**: Returns available tools via MCP `list_tools` handler.
- **Tool Execution**: Executes tools via MCP `call_tool` handler.
- **Transport**: SSE transport at `/messages/` endpoint.

### 4.5 Kubernetes Configuration

- **Namespace**: `mcp-paloalto`
- **Metallb**: IP pool (e.g., 192.168.1.100-192.168.1.150)
- **Traefik**: Deployed as ingress controller with TLS termination
- **Deployment**: 2 replicas of MCP server

## 5. User Stories

### 5.1 As a Windsurf Developer

- **US1**: I want to retrieve a list of available tools so I can integrate them into my MCP workflow.
- **US2**: I want to execute a tool to fetch address objects so I can manage IP mappings.
- **US3**: I want to retrieve security zones so I can configure network segmentation.
- **US4**: I want to access security policies so I can audit firewall rules.

### 5.2 As a DevOps Engineer

- **US5**: I want to deploy the application in Kubernetes so it’s scalable and reliable.
- **US6**: I want TLS termination at Traefik so communication is secure.

---

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

### 6.1 Tool Functionality

- Given a valid API key and firewall hostname, when I call the `retrieve_address_objects` tool, then I receive a list of address objects as TextContent.
- Given a running server, when I list tools, then I receive definitions for all three tools with their parameters.

### 6.2 Deployment

- Given the Kubernetes manifests, when I deploy the application, then it runs with 2 replicas and is accessible via Traefik.
- Given a Metallb configuration, when traffic is sent to the service, then it is load-balanced across pods.

### 6.3 Security

- Given sensitive credentials, when I deploy the app, then they are stored in Kubernetes Secrets.
- Given an invalid parameter, when I make a request, then I receive a validation error.

## 7. Risks and Mitigations

### 7.1 Risks

- **R1**: Palo Alto API rate limits could impact performance.
- **R2**: Misconfiguration of Traefik or Metallb could cause downtime.

### 7.2 Mitigations

- **M2**: Include detailed deployment documentation and health checks.

---

## 8. Monitoring and Metrics

- **M1**: Configure structured logging with request IDs.
- **M2**: Set up Kubernetes liveness/readiness probes.

## 9. Future Considerations

- Add support for additional Palo Alto API endpoints (e.g., NAT policies).
- Implement authentication middleware for API access control.
- Support multiple firewall instances via configuration.

## 10. Appendix

### 10.1 Example Tool Call (via MCP Client)

```python
result = await session.call_tool(
    "retrieve_security_policies",
    {"location": "vsys", "vsys": "vsys1"}
)
```

### 10.2 Example Response

```python
[
    TextContent(
        type="text",
        text='{"name": "rule1", "source": ["any"], "destination": ["any"], "action": "allow"}'
    )
]
```

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Framework Shift**: Replaced FastAPI-specific references with MCP Python SDK implementation details based on the provided examples from the repository.
2. **Endpoints**: Removed FastAPI-specific endpoints (`/mcp/tools`, `/mcp/execute`) and replaced them with MCP protocol handlers (`list_tools` and `call_tool`).
3. **Transport**: Added SSE transport support as shown in the SDK example, aligning with the server implementation.
4. **Output Format**: Updated tool outputs to use `TextContent` from the MCP types instead of raw JSON.
5. **Directory Structure**: Simplified to match the SDK example structure while maintaining Palo Alto-specific components.
6. **Dependencies**: Updated to reflect MCP SDK requirements (`mcp`, `httpx`, `anyio`) instead of FastAPI-specific ones.
7. **Examples**: Updated the appendix to show MCP client usage instead of HTTP requests.

This revised PRD aligns with the MCP server implementation from the provided SDK examples while maintaining the original project's goals and requirements. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
