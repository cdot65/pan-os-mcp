## 6. Acceptance Criteria

### 6.1 Tool Functionality

- Given a valid API key and firewall hostname, when I call the `retrieve_address_objects` tool, then I receive a list of address objects in the proper format
- Given a running server, when I list tools, then I receive definitions for all three tools with their parameters

### 6.2 npm Package

- Given an npm installation, when I run `npm install -g palo-alto-mcp`, then the package installs successfully
- Given a proper Windsurf configuration, when the MCP client launches the server, then the server starts correctly
- Given environment variables with API credentials, when the server starts, then it connects to the Palo Alto firewall

### 6.3 Integration

- Given a standard MCP client, when I configure it with the command/args pattern, then it can successfully interact with the server
- Given a successful tool execution, when the response is ready, then it's properly returned to the client

### 6.4 TypeScript Implementation

- Given the Cloudflare MCP server model, when I implement the server, then it follows the same patterns and structure
- Given TypeScript's type system, when I develop the API client, then it has proper type definitions for all Palo Alto API responses

### 6.5 Security

- Given sensitive credentials, when I configure them via environment variables, then they are securely accessed by the server
- Given an invalid parameter, when I make a request, then I receive a validation error with proper typing
