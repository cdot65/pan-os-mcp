# SDK Version 1.8.0 Import Issues

## Problem

When updating the `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` from version 0.3.0 to 1.8.0, we encountered multiple import issues:

1. The SDK structure had changed significantly between versions
2. Import paths like `'@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/types.js'` were no longer valid
3. Attempting to fix with explicit import paths (`'@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/dist/esm/types.js'`) also failed
4. The build process was failing during `npm install` due to TypeScript type resolution errors

Error messages included:
```
Cannot find module '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk' or its corresponding type declarations.
```

## Root Cause

The ModelContextProtocol SDK had been completely overhauled in version 1.8.0, introducing a higher-level API (`McpServer`) that replaced the lower-level `Server` class we were using. The module organization and import structure were significantly different from the version we originally built against.

## Solution

1. **Architectural Change**: Moved from the low-level `Server` approach to the new high-level `McpServer` API
   - Replaced `Server` and request handlers with the more declarative `McpServer` API
   - Used `.tool()` method for direct tool registration instead of handling `CallToolRequestSchema`

2. **Code Consolidation**: Moved tool implementations from separate files into main.ts
   - Removed the separate tool files (`address-objects.ts`, `security-zones.ts`, `security-policies.ts`)
   - Simplified the architecture by centralizing all tool definitions in one place

3. **Import Updates**: Updated the import statements to match the new SDK structure
   - Changed from: `import { Server } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/index.js'`
   - To: `import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js"`

4. **Parameter Validation**: Leveraged the built-in Zod integration in the new SDK
   - Used the direct parameter definition with Zod schemas in the `.tool()` method
   - Removed separate validation logic we had previously implemented

## Example of the New Pattern

```typescript
// Old approach:
const server = new Server(
  { name: 'palo-alto-mcp', version: '0.1.0' },
  { capabilities: { tools: {} } },
);

server.setRequestHandler(CallToolRequestSchema, async (request) => {
  const toolName = request.params.name;
  // Routing logic to different handlers
}); 

// New approach:
const server = new McpServer({
  name: 'palo-alto-mcp',
  version: '0.1.0'
});

server.tool(
  'retrieve_address_objects',
  {
    location: z.string({ required_error: 'Location parameter is required' }),
    vsys: z.string().default('vsys1')
  },
  async ({ location, vsys }) => {
    // Implementation directly here
    return {
      content: [
        {
          type: 'text',
          text: JSON.stringify(result, null, 2),
        },
      ]
    };
  }
);
```

## Benefits of the New Approach

1. More declarative code with less boilerplate
2. Built-in parameter validation with Zod
3. Simpler architecture with fewer files
4. Better alignment with the current SDK documentation and patterns
5. More maintainable code structure going forward

## Lessons Learned

1. When upgrading SDK versions, check for architectural changes, not just API changes
2. Look for official documentation or examples of the updated SDK
3. Consider consolidating code when new patterns make file separation redundant
4. Leverage built-in SDK features for common tasks like parameter validation
