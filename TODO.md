# TODO.md: MCP Palo Alto Integration Server

This TODO list outlines the tasks required to develop the MCP Palo Alto Integration Server as specified in the Product Requirements Document (PRD). Tasks are grouped by implementation phases and key areas of focus.

---

## Phase 1: Project Setup and API Integration (April 10 - April 17, 2025)

- [ ] **Project Initialization**

  - [ ] Set up TypeScript project with `tsconfig.json` using strict mode
  - [ ] Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality
  - [ ] Create directory structure as per PRD (src/, tests/, etc.)
  - [ ] Initialize `package.json` with necessary dependencies (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `undici` or `node-fetch`, `zod`)
  - [ ] Add initial `README.md` with project overview

- [ ] **Palo Alto API Client**
  - [ ] Implement `pan-os-api.ts` with HTTPS connection to Palo Alto NGFW XML API
  - [ ] Add authentication mechanism using API keys via environment variables
  - [ ] Define TypeScript interfaces for API responses (address objects, security zones, security policies)
  - [ ] Test basic API connectivity with a sample firewall

---

## Phase 2: MCP Server Implementation (April 18 - May 1, 2025)

- [ ] **Core MCP Server**

  - [ ] Implement `main.ts` with MCP server logic following Cloudflare MCP pattern
  - [ ] Add `list_tools` handler to return available tools (address objects, security zones, security policies)
  - [ ] Add `call_tool` handler to execute requested tools
  - [ ] Set up standard I/O transport for command-line execution
  - [ ] Ensure server supports `command`/`args` pattern for client integration

- [ ] **Tool Definitions**

  - [ ] Create `address-objects.ts` to retrieve address objects from Palo Alto API
  - [ ] Create `security-zones.ts` to retrieve security zones from Palo Alto API
  - [ ] Create `security-policies.ts` to retrieve security policies from Palo Alto API
  - [ ] Format tool outputs as `TextContent` per MCP standards

- [ ] **Utilities**

  - [ ] Implement `helpers.ts` with common utility functions (e.g., error handling, logging)
  - [ ] Add input validation using Zod in `call_tool` handler
  - [ ] Set up audit logging for all operations

- [ ] **Configuration**
  - [ ] Enable environment variable support for API credentials and settings
  - [ ] Support `mcp_config.json` for client configuration

---

## Phase 3: Testing and Documentation (May 2 - May 8, 2025)

- [ ] **Testing**

  - [ ] Write unit tests for `pan-os-api.ts` (API connectivity, response parsing)
  - [ ] Write integration tests for `list_tools` and `call_tool` handlers
  - [ ] Test tool execution with Windsurf client
  - [ ] Verify concurrent client connection support
  - [ ] Test error handling for API failures and invalid inputs

- [ ] **Documentation**
  - [ ] Update `README.md` with installation instructions (`npm install -g palo-alto-mcp`)
  - [ ] Add usage examples for running via `npx -y palo-alto-mcp`
  - [ ] Document environment variables (e.g., API URL, credentials)
  - [ ] Include troubleshooting section with common error messages

---

## Phase 4: Release (May 9 - May 15, 2025)

- [ ] **npm Packaging**

  - [ ] Finalize `package.json` with binary entry point (`palo-alto-mcp`)
  - [ ] Test local installation (`npm install`) and global installation (`npm install -g`)
  - [ ] Publish package to npm registry
  - [ ] Verify `npx -y palo-alto-mcp` works as expected

- [ ] **Release Activities**
  - [ ] Draft release announcement for stakeholders
  - [ ] Tag MVP release (v0.1.0) in version control
  - [ ] Collect initial feedback from Windsurf team

---

## Additional Requirements

- [ ] **Performance**

  - [ ] Ensure tool requests process within 2 seconds (excluding API latency)
  - [ ] Optimize startup time for command-based execution

- [ ] **Security**

  - [ ] Securely store and access API keys via environment variables
  - [ ] Implement input validation to prevent injection attacks
  - [ ] Add graceful shutdown on client termination

- [ ] **Reliability**

  - [ ] Handle API failures with clear error messages
  - [ ] Test server resilience with intermittent network issues

- [ ] **Monitoring**
  - [ ] Add structured logging with request IDs
  - [ ] Implement verbose debug mode toggle

---

## Post-MVP Tasks (May 16 - June 1, 2025)

- [ ] Finalize full release (v1.0.0) with all feedback addressed
- [ ] Test in multiple npm environments to ensure consistency
- [ ] Add caching mechanism for frequently requested data
- [ ] Document future enhancement ideas (e.g., additional API endpoints, CLI mode)

---

## Milestones

- [ ] **MVP Release**: May 15, 2025
- [ ] **Full Release**: June 1, 2025
