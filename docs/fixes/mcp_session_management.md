# MCP Session Management Issue Fix

## Problem Description

We encountered an issue with session management between the MCP server and client. The error manifested as:

```
Warning: {"request_id": "...", "message": "Message for unknown session", "session_id": "..."}
```

This occurred because we were trying to manually manage session IDs instead of following the MCP SDK's designed workflow.

The root cause was:

1. We attempted to modify the `InitializationOptions` object by setting a session_id field which doesn't exist in the SDK
2. We tried to maintain custom session tracking via an `active_sessions` dictionary
3. Our implementation of the SSE endpoint handler didn't follow the SDK's expected pattern

## Solution

The solution was to follow the exact pattern provided in the MCP SDK examples for handling the SSE connection and letting the SDK manage sessions internally:

```python
async def handle_sse(request):
    """Handle SSE connection from client."""
    async with sse_transport.connect_sse(
        request.scope, request.receive, request._send
    ) as streams:
        # Create initialization options
        init_options = mcp_server.create_initialization_options()
        # Run the MCP server with the streams
        await mcp_server.run(streams[0], streams[1], init_options)
```

### Key Insights

1. **Session Management Flow in MCP SDK**:
   - The SSE connection establishes the session
   - The SDK generates a session ID internally
   - The server sends this ID to the client via an initial event in the SSE stream
   - The client extracts this session ID and uses it for subsequent requests to the message endpoint

2. **No Custom Session Tracking Needed**:
   - The SDK's `SseServerTransport` class maintains its own session mapping
   - We don't need to manually track or pass around session IDs
   - Attempting to modify or inject session IDs disrupts the SDK's internal flow

3. **ASGI Interface Handling**:
   - The SSE endpoint handler should be a standard Starlette request handler
   - Inside the handler, we delegate to the SDK's `connect_sse` method which expects ASGI triplet
   - The handler should use a proper `async with` context manager

## Debugging Tips

When troubleshooting MCP session issues:

1. Check if the client is receiving a session ID from the SSE connection
2. Verify the client is using that exact session ID in requests to the message endpoint
3. Ensure your SSE handler follows the exact pattern from the SDK examples
4. Don't try to manually modify session IDs or add custom session tracking
