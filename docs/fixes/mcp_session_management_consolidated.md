# MCP Session Management - Consolidated Fix

## Issue Description

When working with the MCP server, we encountered a critical issue where clients received "Could not find session" errors despite having valid credentials. This document consolidates our analysis, findings, and the final solution to this session management problem.

## Root Cause Analysis

Our investigation revealed that the issue wasn't related to the Palo Alto API credentials, but rather stemmed from a fundamental misunderstanding of how session management works in the MCP SDK:

1. **Incorrect Session Management Approach**: We attempted to manually manage session IDs and track them in a custom dictionary (`active_sessions`), which conflicted with the SDK's built-in session management.

2. **Improper SSE Handler Implementation**: Our SSE connection handler didn't follow the pattern prescribed by the MCP SDK, causing disconnects between client sessions and server handling.

3. **Mismatched Asynchronous Context Management**: The connection streams weren't being properly maintained through the lifecycle of the SSE connection.

## MCP SDK Session Flow (Correct Model)

The MCP SDK uses the following flow for session management:

1. **Session Establishment**:
   - Client connects to the `/sse` endpoint
   - SDK generates a unique session ID (UUID)
   - SDK sends this ID to the client in the first SSE event
   - SDK maintains internal mapping of session IDs to stream writers

2. **Message Exchange**:
   - Client uses this session ID in subsequent requests to `/messages/`
   - SDK uses this ID to route messages to the correct session's streams
   - If a session ID is invalid or expired, the request is rejected

3. **Session Termination**:
   - When the SSE connection closes, the SDK cleans up the session automatically
   - Any subsequent requests using that session ID are rejected

## Solution Implementation

The solution was to follow the MCP SDK's prescribed pattern exactly, with robust error handling to gracefully manage client disconnections:

```python
async def handle_sse(request):
    """Handle SSE connection from client."""
    client = f"{request.client[0]}:{request.client[1]}" if request.client else "unknown"
    logger.info(f"New MCP SSE connection from {client}")

    try:
        # Follow the exact pattern from the MCP SDK example
        async with sse_transport.connect_sse(request.scope, request.receive, request._send) as streams:
            logger.info(f"SSE session established for {client}")
            # Create initialization options
            init_options = mcp_server.create_initialization_options()

            # Run the MCP server with the streams
            try:
                await mcp_server.run(streams[0], streams[1], init_options)
            except anyio.BrokenResourceError as e:
                # This is expected when client disconnects
                logger.info(f"Client {client} disconnected: {str(e)}")
            except Exception as e:
                logger.error(f"Error during MCP server run: {str(e)}", exc_info=True)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error establishing SSE connection: {str(e)}", exc_info=True)
    finally:
        logger.info(f"SSE connection closed for client {client}")
```

Key changes included:

1. **Following Exact SDK Pattern**:
   - Used the SDK's connect_sse exactly as shown in their examples
   - Let the SDK handle all aspects of the SSE connection
   - Avoided attempting to create our own streaming response

2. **Improved Exception Handling**:
   - Added specific handling for `BrokenResourceError` which occurs when clients disconnect
   - Separated connection establishment errors from server runtime errors
   - Used a finally block to ensure proper logging of connection closure

3. **Detailed Logging**:
   - Added client information to all logs
   - Included different log messages for different stages of the connection lifecycle
   - Used different log levels appropriately (INFO for normal operations, ERROR for issues)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Strict SDK Pattern Adherence**: The MCP SDK has specific patterns for handling SSE connections and session management that must be followed exactly. Deviating from these patterns, even with seemingly better implementations, causes issues.

2. **Let the SDK Manage Sessions**: The SDK has internal mechanisms to generate, track, and validate session IDs. Do not attempt to override or supplement this with custom session management.

3. **Handle Disconnection Gracefully**: Client disconnections are normal events in SSE connections and should be handled gracefully rather than treated as errors.

4. **Context Manager Usage**: The `connect_sse` context manager handles proper connection establishment and cleanup, and must be used with `async with`.

5. **Error Classification**: Distinguish between normal disconnection events (`BrokenResourceError`) and actual server errors to avoid log pollution and false alarms.

## Prevention

To avoid similar issues in the future:

1. **Study SDK Examples**: Always refer to SDK examples for the correct implementation patterns.

2. **Add Debugging Hooks**: Implement session lifecycle hooks for better visibility.

3. **Test Session Management**: Verify session establishment before making tool calls.

4. **Maintain Consistent Endpoint Configurations**: Ensure client and server use consistent paths (especially trailing slashes).

5. **Document Session Flow**: Maintain clear documentation of the session establishment and message exchange flow.
