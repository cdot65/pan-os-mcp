# MCP Session Management - Consolidated Fix

## Issue Description

When working with the MCP server, we encountered a critical issue where clients received "Could not find session" errors despite having valid credentials. This document consolidates our analysis, findings, and the final solution to this session management problem.

## Root Cause Analysis

Our investigation revealed that the issue wasn't related to the Palo Alto API credentials, but rather stemmed from a fundamental misunderstanding of how session management works in the MCP SDK:

1. **Incorrect Session Management Approach**: We attempted to manually manage session IDs and track them in a custom dictionary (`active_sessions`), which conflicted with the SDK's built-in session management.

2. **Improper SSE Handler Implementation**: Our SSE connection handler didn't follow the pattern prescribed by the MCP SDK, causing disconnects between client sessions and server handling.

3. **Mismatched Asynchronous Context Management**: The connection streams weren't being properly maintained through the lifecycle of the SSE connection.

## MCP SDK Session Flow (Correct Model)

The MCP SDK uses the following flow for session management:

1. **Session Establishment**:
   - Client connects to the `/sse` endpoint
   - SDK generates a unique session ID (UUID)
   - SDK sends this ID to the client in the first SSE event
   - SDK maintains internal mapping of session IDs to stream writers

2. **Message Exchange**:
   - Client uses this session ID in subsequent requests to `/messages/`
   - SDK uses this ID to route messages to the correct session's streams
   - If a session ID is invalid or expired, the request is rejected

3. **Session Termination**:
   - When the SSE connection closes, the SDK cleans up the session automatically
   - Any subsequent requests using that session ID are rejected

## Solution Implementation

The solution was to follow the MCP SDK's prescribed pattern exactly:

```python
async def handle_sse(request):
    """Handle SSE connection from client."""
    client = f"{request.client[0]}:{request.client[1]}" if request.client else "unknown"
    logger.info(f"New MCP SSE connection from {client}")

    # Follow the exact pattern from the MCP SDK example
    async with sse_transport.connect_sse(request.scope, request.receive, request._send) as streams:
        logger.info("SSE session established")
        # Create initialization options
        init_options = mcp_server.create_initialization_options()
        # Run the MCP server with the streams
        await mcp_server.run(streams[0], streams[1], init_options)
```

Key changes included:

1. **Removing Custom Session Management**:
   - Eliminated our custom `active_sessions` dictionary
   - Removed manual session ID generation and tracking
   - Let the SDK handle session ID creation and tracking entirely

2. **Using Correct Async Context Management**:
   - Implemented the SSE handler using an `async with` context manager
   - Ensured proper stream lifecycle management
   - Let the SDK manage the association between sessions and streams

3. **Following SDK Example Pattern**:
   - Based our implementation on the official SDK examples
   - Used the SDK's established patterns for handling connections
   - Delegated session management to the SDK's built-in functionality

4. **Adding Session Lifecycle Hooks**:
   - Implemented `on_session_start` and `on_session_end` hooks
   - Added proper logging of session events
   - Improved visibility into session creation and termination

## Learnings

1. **Follow SDK Patterns**: The MCP SDK has a specific designed pattern for session management that should be followed exactly.

2. **Delegate to the SDK**: Instead of implementing custom session tracking, delegate this to the SDK's built-in mechanisms.

3. **Use Proper Async Patterns**: Use `async with` context managers for stream lifecycle management.

4. **Add Sufficient Logging**: Implement session lifecycle hooks to track session creation and termination.

5. **Keep Implementation Simple**: Avoid adding complexity that isn't required by the SDK design.

## Prevention

To avoid similar issues in the future:

1. **Study SDK Examples**: Always refer to SDK examples for the correct implementation patterns.

2. **Add Debugging Hooks**: Implement session lifecycle hooks for better visibility.

3. **Test Session Management**: Verify session establishment before making tool calls.

4. **Maintain Consistent Endpoint Configurations**: Ensure client and server use consistent paths (especially trailing slashes).

5. **Document Session Flow**: Maintain clear documentation of the session establishment and message exchange flow.
