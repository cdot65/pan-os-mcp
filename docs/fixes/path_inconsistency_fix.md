# Path Inconsistency Fix

## Issue Description

We identified a critical path inconsistency in the MCP server implementation that was likely causing the `BrokenResourceError` during tool calls. The discrepancy was between:

1. How the SSE transport was configured: `SseServerTransport("/messages/")`
2. How the route was mounted in Starlette: `Mount("/messages", app=sse_transport.handle_post_message)`
3. The client configuration: `"messageEndpoint": "http://localhost:8001/messages/"`

This inconsistency was causing HTTP 307 redirects, which likely interfered with the session management in the MCP SDK, leading to broken connections.

## Fix Implementation

We standardized all paths to use the trailing slash format, which is the pattern explicitly shown in the MCP SDK example code:

```python
# Before fix
Mount("/messages", app=sse_transport.handle_post_message)  # No trailing slash

# After fix
Mount("/messages/", app=sse_transport.handle_post_message)  # With trailing slash
```

## Technical Analysis

The MCP SDK's `SseServerTransport` class creates session IDs and expects clients to access the message endpoint using query parameters:

```python
session_id = uuid4()
session_uri = f"{quote(self._endpoint)}?session_id={session_id.hex}"
```

When our server routes didn't match the expected endpoint exactly, the following would happen:

1. The SDK would tell the client to connect to `/messages/?session_id=<ID>`
2. Our server only had `/messages` registered (no trailing slash)
3. HTTP servers typically redirect `/messages/` to `/messages` (307 Temporary Redirect)
4. During this redirect, the session context might be lost or not properly maintained
5. When the client sends a tool request, the server couldn't find the associated session
6. When the server tried to send the response, it resulted in `BrokenResourceError`

By ensuring that both the SDK initialization and the route registration use the exact same path pattern, we've eliminated the redirect and should now maintain proper session context.

## Verification

The server should now properly handle SSE connections and tool calls without `BrokenResourceError` occurrences.

To verify the fix:
1. Start the server with the updated code
2. Check the logs to confirm that SSE sessions are established correctly
3. Make tool calls through the client and verify successful responses
4. Monitor logs for any remaining errors or issues
